Dark Mode — Novelty or Better User Experience? This can be true and false depending on the context. For some experiences it can be helpful to the user if you can match the interface with their environment.

A great example of this is Google Maps. When driving at night the interface changes to a dark theme as not to distract the driver with a glaring bright screen.

In the case of raywenderlich.com tutorials — staring at a bright screen all day can be tiring on your eyes. If you’re studying our tutorials after work or school, having the option to change the contrast so you can concentrate easier can be helpful.

Does raywenderlich.com get enough traffic during twilight hours to support a dark theme?

This is a resounding yes! According to Google Analytics the most popular time for visiting our website is after work and late into the night (21:00-00:00). Now, we felt based on this data. A dark theme for raywenderlich.com would be a useful feature.

We wanted our dark theme to be cutting edge so we leveraged a new browser feature — all hail **‘prefers-color-scheme’**. _Note: This currently only works with Safari Technology Preview 69+ but we expect this be a common feature in other browsers soon._

**'prefers-color-scheme'** checks your OS Appearance setting in System Preferences and changes the website to match. Changing the setting here changes the appearance of raywenderlich.com. Crazy I know, but this is real life!

If you want something similar for your website I’ve broken down how it works in 3 easy steps. _Note: You'll need some basic HTML, CSS and Javacript._

1. Add CSS class for dark theme to stylesheet
2. Use Javascript to check the users OS appearance setting
3. Add a toggle to manually change website theme

**1. Add CSS class for dark theme to stylesheet**

Inside your CSS class is where you’ll write the styles for your website elements and classes when using a dark theme. I had to go through every page on raywenderlich.com and note down elements that needed to change once using a dark theme. After adding all the class and element style changes to my CSS class ‘l-prefers-color-scheme--dark’ my dark theme styles came in at 500 lines. This snippet shows the start of my dark theme class:


```css

.l-prefers-color-scheme--dark{
  background-color: #333333;
  color: #ffffff;
}

```


**3.  Use Javascript to check the users OS appearance setting**

Safari Technology Preview 69+ makes your OS appearance setting available to the browser. Using the snippet below, we fetch the users OS appearance setting and if the dark appearance is selected we add our ‘l-prefers-color-scheme--dark’ class to the HTML ```<body class="l-prefers-color-scheme--dark">```. This allows our dark theme CSS to be active.

After completing this step we’ve successfully matched the website to the users OS. Try it out — If you visit raywenderlich.com using Safari Technology Preview 69+ the website theme will match your OS appearance setting. 

_Note: You'll need to refresh the web page after changing your OS appearance._

**4.  Add a toggle to manually change website theme**

We now have a sentient website theme! However in some cases, the user might not desire this specified outcome. So we added a switch to manually toggle the dark theme. This snippet toggles our class ‘l-prefers-color-scheme--dark’  the same way as step 3 and allows the user to control the website appearance. We remember the users chosen theme by using a cookie.

And that’s it —

So if you’re a night owl like our CTO Sam Davies or just prefer reading on a dark UI we’ve added a ‘Night Mode’ to raywenderlich.com. Enjoy!
