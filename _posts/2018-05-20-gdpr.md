We're living in interesting times regarding user privacy and protection of data. Over the past few years access to large amounts of our personal data has increasingly become the price we pay to use many online services, all too often without much knowledge of this fact.

This has largely been unregulated, as the laws struggle to keep up with technological change. GDPR is the latest in a line of regulations that have passed to attempt to make the use of personal information more transparent, and in many respects it looks like it will be the most successful.

You've probably seen a lot of notifications from different websites and services you use requesting that agree to a new, clearer privacy policy. These changes are all a knock-on effect of GDPR, and as you may have noticed Razeware (raywenderlich.com) has jumped on the bandwagon.

In this post we'll take a look at some of the changes that have come into effect, together with the process that we undertook as a company to assess and work towards compliance. First though, let's review what GDPR actually is.

# What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is legislation from the EU which specifies the rights of every EU citizen when they interact with websites and services. That sentence alone includes an incredibly significant nuance—the regulation is applied to all companies that have EU citizens that are users or customers. This includes companies such as Razeware based in the US.

The core tenets of GDPR can be summarised as follows:

- Collect only what you need.  
- Obtain consent to collect it.
- Allow users to download their data.
- Allow users to delete their data.
- Store it securely.
- Use it only for the intended purpose.
- Don't keep it longer than necessary.
- Take responsibility for 3rd-parties collecting and processing your users' data.

These all seem like perfectly reasonable requirements for collecting personal data, but what actually constitutes personal data?

> ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;
> - article 2, GDPR

Most significantly is anything that can uniquely identify a user is considered personal information, including an IP address.


# Handling GDPR Compliance

We started planning our GDPR compliance project at Razeware in March 2018—giving us more than two months to establish and execute an approach.

The first problem was establishing exactly what GDPR meant in the context of raywenderlich.com, involving an extensive literature review of official sources and informative blog posts.
